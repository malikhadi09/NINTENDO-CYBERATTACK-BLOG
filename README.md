# NINTENDO-CYBERATTACK-BLOG

# OPEN HADIWEBPAGE.rar 
=> Extract the folder it contains all the file.

# OPEN INDEX.html 
=> And the webpage will be open.

# What to make..

# Instructions

1. Visit the webpage: https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/top-100-cybersecurity-breaches/
2. It lists top 100 cyber attacks ever. Pick an incident of your choice and post it on google sheet (link below) to book that topic: 
          https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n0MRvAN5McQq5hZ7rUQ5R74uy2h6ZZCe4KSOZ8XGhpM/edit
3. Create a webpage using rich multimedia, images and interactive content to explain the basics of that attack.
4. Then pick any two opensource web servers (https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/best-open-source-web-servers) to host your page on your laptop.


# Requirements (3mks, 3mks, 4mks)

1. Test the webpage on:
      i. laptop and desktop PC (in IT lab),
      ii. cell phone (both portrait/landscape) and on projector in room 6401 (or laptop with min brightness) with direct bright sunlight falling
2.   Incorporate a control panel at the top right corner of webpage with following features:
      i. dark mode button/toggle
      ii. text only mode button/toggle
      iii. battery optimized mode (should switch to this mode automatically if battery < 10%)
3. Compare the loading times on two different servers as chosen earlier. Use chrome dev tools to benchmark performance / delays

# COMPARING APACHE AND XAAMP PERFORMANCE:
We have demonstrated that Apache outperformed Xampp in terms of web performance. Through rigorous testing and analysis, we have shown that Apache provides a faster and more reliable web server solution than Xampp. Therefore, we recommend using Apache for web development and hosting projects that require optimal web performance.
